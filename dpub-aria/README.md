Publisher implementations
=========================

The following table provides a list of publishers who have stated that they are currently using the vocabulary in production or who are in the process of rolling out their implementations.

Note that all respondents indicated they are already using the Digital Publishing vocabulary in conjunction with the ARIA `role` attribute (i.e., none of the recorded uses are based on a projected change from the `epub:type` attribute once the vocabulary becomes a recommendation).

Authoring tool implementations
==============================

The [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) editor includes the ability to author roles from the Digital Publishing vocabulary in both EPUB publications and (X)HTML pages.


Reading system implementations
==============================

As EPUB 3 reading systems are built on browser cores, they will inherit traditional support for the Digital Publishing roles as their mappings are implemented.

Developers of the [Readium](http://readium.org/) reading system implemented experimental support for the `role` attribute in place of `epub:type` during the EPUB 3.1 revision, for the specialized  purposes it serves (e.g., identifying the table of contents). The implementation was not publicly released, however, because the `epub:type` attribute was retained as the primary semantic inflection mechanism.

As many other reading systems already use `epub:type` to provide special beahviours (e.g., pop-up footnotes), it is fully expected that support for the DPUB-ARIA publishing roles will grow as future publishing standards move to use roles as their primary means of semantic inflection.
